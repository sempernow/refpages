# [The Twelve Factors](https://12factor.net/)  

-  [Immutable Web Apps](https://immutablewebapps.org/)

## I. [Codebase](https://12factor.net/codebase)
One codebase per app and its many deploys (running instances).  
Versioned (_repo_); Dev, Test, Staging, Prod, ... _all share a root commit_.
## II. [Dependencies](https://12factor.net/dependencies)
Explicitly __declare__ and __isolate__ dependencies per _dependency declaration manifest_;  
dependencies _scoped per app_ (vendoring/bundling), not system-wide pkgs.  
Any required system (`bash`) tools (e.g., `curl`) are vendored into the app.  

## III. [Config](https://12factor.net/config)
Store (per deploy) configuration @ Env. Vars. (`env`);   
mutually orthogonal, language/OS agnostic.
## IV. [Backing services](https://12factor.net/backing-services)
Loose coupling; treat backing services as attached resources;   
swappable sans app code change, only config change;   
accessed per URL or other locator/credentials stored in the config;  
app makes no distinction between local and third party services

## V. [Stages: Build, Release, Run](https://12factor.net/build-release-run)
Strict separation between build and release stages.  

- Build: transforms code repo into an executable bundle; a _build_.
- Release: `ID = Build + Config`; immutable  
executable @ execution environment  
- Run (runtime): runs app @ execution environment; leanest stage;  
runs specified app process(es) against a selected app release.

## VI. [Processes](https://12factor.net/processes)
Execute the app as one or more stateless processes;  
each process is stateless and shares nothing.   
Stateful backing service(es) handle persistence.  
Process may utilize single-transaction cache.  
No sticky sessions; use time-expiration datastore (Memcached/Redis).  
Package assets during the build stage.


## VII. [Port binding](https://12factor.net/port-binding)
Export services via port binding

App is completely self-contained; no runtime injection of a webserver;  
exports HTTP as a service by binding to a port,  
and listening to requests coming in on that port;  
one app can become the backing service for another app,   
whereof the backing app URL is declared in the config of consuming app.

## VIII. [Concurrency](https://12factor.net/concurrency)
Scale out via the Unix process model (service daemons)  

The share-nothing, horizontally partitionable nature of twelve-factor app processes   
means that adding more concurrency is a simple and reliable operation.   

## IX. [Disposability](https://12factor.net/disposability)
Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown;  
easier to move processes to new physical machines when warranted.

Processes shut down gracefully when they receive a SIGTERM signal from the process manager.   

Processes should also be robust against sudden death, in the case of a failure in the underlying hardware.  
A recommended approach is use of a robust queueing backend;  
return jobs to the queue when clients disconnect or time out. 

## X. [Dev/Prod Parity](https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity)
Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible.  
Design for [Continuous Deployment](https://avc.com/2011/02/continuous-deployment/).

## XI. [Logs](https://12factor.net/logs)
Treat logs as event streams

Logs provide visibility into the behavior of a running app; the stream of aggregated,   
time-ordered events collected from the output streams of all running processes and backing services;  
flow continuously as long as the app is operating.

Each running process writes its event stream, unbuffered, to stdout.  

- @ development, can observe the app’s behavior.

- @ staging or production deploys, each process’ stream is managed by the execution environment.  
Open-source log routers (Logplex/Fluentd) are available for this purpose.  
The event stream for an app can be routed to a file, or watched via realtime tail in a terminal.   
The stream can be sent to a log indexing and analysis system (Splunk), or warehoused (Hadoop/Hive).   
Allows for powerful/flexible introspecting an app’s behavior:

## XII. [Admin processes](https://12factor.net/admin-processes)
Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

Languages which provide a REPL shell out of the box make this easy.
