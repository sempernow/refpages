	MINGW64 [MinGW-64.org]; the current, viable MinGW project; separated from mingw.org per GNU's fanatical mandates madness [REF:Linus Torvalds complaint]; MinGW-64 repos/tools are included in MSYS2 project, Git-for-Windows [SDK], and others; MINGW64 is Cygwin-compatible per 'mingw64-'* packages.

	Use MSYS2 
	
	MSYS2; an environment for building native Windows software. MSYS2 provides a large collection of packages containing such software, and libraries for their development. As a large portion of the software uses GNU build tools which are tightly coupled to the unix world, this environment is also POSIX-compatible, and is in fact based on Cygwin. 	

	MSYS2 uses Pacman (of Arch Linux) to manage its packages, and comes with 
	3 different package REPOSITORIES:
		
		- msys2: Containing MSYS2-dependent software
		- mingw64: Containing 64-bit native Windows software (compiled w/ mingw-w64 x86_64 toolchain)
		- mingw32: Containing 32-bit native Windows software (compiled w/ mingw-w64 i686 toolchain)

	are GNU/bash build tools ported to Windows

			'MinGW' 		- gcc compiler

	Downloaded/Installed/Tried several [below];
	Currently using MinGW + MSYS packages from MinGW.org

	# MinGW.org [32 bit]
		
		gcc 5.3.0	[mingw-get-setup.exe]

		'mingw-get install' ...
		
			mingw-developer-toolkit		installs MSYS

			mingw32-base				installs gcc, make etal

			mingw32-binutils			installs binutils

		
		make.exe and other bash uttils are @ MSYS [.\msys subfolder], 
		so BOTH \bin paths need to be added to PATH ... 

			C:\MinGW\bin
			C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin
			
			(See MinGW.bat @ UzerX cmd-library)
