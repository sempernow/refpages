7-Zip 9.20  Copyright (c) 1999-2010 Igor Pavlov  2010-11-18

Usage: 7z <command> [<switches>...] <archive_name> [<file_names>...]
       [<@listfiles...>]

Commands and switches can be entered in upper or lower case.
Command is the first non-switch argument.
The "archive_name" must be the first filename on the command line after the command.
The switches and other filenames can be in any order.
Wildcards or filenames with spaces must be quoted:
	"Dir\Program files\*"
    Dir\"Program files"\*

7-Zip uses wild name matching similar to Windows 95:
	'*' means a sequence of arbitrary characters. 
	'?' means any character. 

7-Zip doesn't follow the archaic rule by which *.* means any file. 
7-Zip treats *.* as matching the name of any file that has an extension. 
To process all files, you must use a * wildcard.

	Examples:

	*.txt means all files with an extension of ".txt" 
	?a* means all files with a second character of "a" 
	*1* means all names that contains character "1" 
	*.*.* means all names that contain two at least "." characters 

The default wildcard "*" will be used if there is no filename/wildcard 
in the command line.
Slash ('\') at the end of a path means a directory. 
Without a Slash ('\') at the end of the path, 
the path can refer either to a file or a directory.
