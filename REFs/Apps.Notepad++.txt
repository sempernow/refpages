INSTALL 
=======
  * Download 32-bit installer, NOT 64-bit.
    E.g., "Notepad++ Installer 32-bit x86";
    most plugins are incompatible w/ 64-bit;
    
    https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

  * Run the downloaded installer

    - UNcheck auto update during install.
    - UNcheck the two APPDATA-related options. 
    
    - File Associations > NONE
   
  * Run notepad_replace.bat [v1.1]

    notepad_replace.bat x  :: test-mode only

    notepad_replace.bat    :: run for effect
        
    - REQUIRES Administrator; be member of "Administrators" group
    
    - Replaces all 'notepad.exe' with a modified version 
      (named 'notepad.exe', of course) EVERYWHERE under 
      the windows root folder (%windir%).

      This fully integrates Notepad++,; Windows Explorer file manager shows the correct file type, under "type", along with its associated icon, per file type. 
      
      OTHERWISE, if Notepad++ is associated with certain filetypes -- which is "required" if it's not "integrated" using the notepad_replace.bat script -- then ALL associated filetypes are shown only as "Notepad++ file" and have the same Notepad++ icon.

FILETYPES
=========

  * File Association; to enable icons per filetype
  
    - Do NOT use Notepad++ config/prefs, 
      else ALL FILETYPES HAVE SAME ICON.
    
    - Use "Windows Explorer" [Microsoft OS]
    
      1. RT-CLICK > "Open with" > select "Notepad.exe"
    
    - To CHANGE ICON, use "FileTypesMan" [NirSoft]
    
      If you don't like the result, i.e., if it affects other filetypes unwanted, e.g., if .log and .txt have same icon, but you want different ones for each, then ...
      
        1. In FileTypesMan, delete that file type
           FileTypesMan > Edit > Delete "Selected Extensions"
          
        2. In Win Explorer, RT-CLICK on file of target type,
           and set "Open with" to "Notepad.exe"
          
        3. In FileTypeMan, DOUBLE-CLICK on the filetype, 
           and set ONLY its "Description" and "Default Icon"
