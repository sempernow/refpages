# DevOps/[GitOps](https://opengitops.dev/ "OpenGitOps.dev") `v1.0.0` | [CNCF Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/ "Landscape.CNCF.io")

## Overview

DevOps is about automation across the lifecycle of an application.
GitOps extends that with disciplined methods 
&mdash;__Git__ as the single __Source of Truth__ (SoT) 
&mdash;across all layers of all components, 
from infra to services, with the goal of repeatable, 
verifiable deployment states.

GitOps is __an operational framework__ that takes DevOps best practices 
used for application development such as version control, collaboration, compliance and such, 
and applies them to __infrastructure automation__. 
GitOps consists of Infrastructure as Code (__IaC__), configuration management (__CM__) by Git, 
<dfn title="Provide everything below microservices; build an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) to assist your developers in their daily operations.">Platform Engineering</dfn>, 
and <dfn title="A development practice of pipelining an automated merge, build and test of incremental code changes that are recorded and otherwise controlled by immutable versioning">Continuous Integration</dfn> 
and <dfn title="A development practice of pipelining and automated release and deployment such that the process has visibility and feedback by all team members">[Continuous Delivery](Continuous-Delivery-process-diagram.png)</dfn> (__CI/CD__).  

## Why

### Q: 

How many possible configurations are there for __3 hosts__, 
each having __6 services__, each having __6 parameters__, 
__each having only two possible settings__?

This scenario is an artificially simple infrastructure 
to steelman the argument *against* DevOps/GitOps/IaC.
So, let's see what we may see &hellip;

### A: 

1. **Parameters per service**: Each service has 6 parameters, and each parameter has 2 settings. 
So, the number of configurations for one service is:  
`2^6 = 64`

2. **Services per host**: Each host has 6 services, so the number of configurations for one host is:  
`64^6` = `(2^6)^6` = `2^36` = 68,719,476,736

3. **Total hosts**: There are 3 hosts, so the total number of configurations is:  
`(68,719,476,736)^3` = `(2^36)^3` = `2^108`

4. **Final calculation**: `(2^36)^3` = `2^108`

So, the number of possible configurations is:  
`324,518,553,658,426,726,783,156,020,576,256`  
(`~ 3.2 x 10^32`) 

That's many more than a trillion trillion possible configurations.  
More than the estimated number of stars in the Universe.
Not the galaxy. The entire Universe.

And only one of those is the one you want. 
All the others are some kind of misconfiguration. 

Do you like those odds?

DevOps/GitOps/IaC is an upfront cost that pays dividends each time it is applied.
And the more your infa builds out, the larger those per-build dividends grow.

Conversely, absent DevOps/GitOps/IaC, 
every stage of the build out is levied a tax dwarfing that of the prior stage. 
This non-linear explosion of misconfigurations is merciless. 
It grinds down productivity along with morale,
and does so ever more with each iteration.

### Principles

1. __Declarative__  
    A system managed by GitOps must have its desired state expressed declaratively.
2. __Versioned and Immutable__  
    Desired state is stored in a way that enforces immutability, versioning and retains a complete version history.
3. __Pulled Automatically__  
    Software agents automatically pull the desired state declarations from the source.
4. __Continuously Reconciled__  
    Software agents continuously observe actual system state and attempt to apply the desired state.


### Results

- A standard workflow for application development.
- Increased security for setting application requirements upfront.
- Improved reliability with visibility and version control through Git.
- Consistency across clusters and their environments.

## Methods

- __Declarative Configuration__:  
    Use declarative configurations (YAML files) 
    for all resources and store them in a Git repository. 
    This approach ensures that the desired state of your cluster is version-controlled and auditable.
    - __Branching Strategies__:  
        [Trunk-based](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development) 
        rather than [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) 
        to manage different environments (development, staging, production) or to handle feature development and releases.
- __Pull Request Workflow__:  
    Use pull (merge) requests (PR/MR) to manage changes to the Kubernetes configuration. 
    This allows for code review, approval processes, 
    and automated testing before changes are merged and applied.
- __Automated Deployment__:  
    Implement CI/CD pipelines that automatically apply changes from Git to your Kubernetes cluster. 
    This could involve testing changes in a staging environment before promoting them to production.
- __Disaster Recovery__:  
    Regularly back up your Git repository and Kubernetes cluster state. 
    Ensure you have a process in place for restoring from backups in case of a disaster.

Operators implement and automate common Day-1 (installation, configuration, etc.) and Day-2 (re-configuration, update, backup, failover, restore, etc.) activities in a piece of software running in K8s, by integrating natively with K8s concepts and APIs. We call this a K8s-native application. Instead of treating an app as a collection of primitives (Pods, Deployments, Services , ConfigMaps, &hellip;) it's treated as a single object that only exposes the knobs that make sense for the application, extending the core K8s API with <dfn title="Custom Resource Definitions">CRD</dfn>s as needed to do so.

            - Handles secret management and multi-tenancy.
            - __Flagger__ integration: Flux can be used together with Flagger for progressive delivery; advanced deployment strategies.
        - __Flagger__:
            - Automates the release process by gradually shifting traffic to the new version while measuring metrics and running conformance tests. 
              If anomalies are detected, Flagger can automatically rollback.
            - Designed for **progressive delivery** techniques like canary releases, A/B testing, and blue/green deployments.
            - Service-Mesh Integration: Used with service meshes like Istio, Linkerd, and others,

- __Multi-tenancy__
    - [__vCluster__](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster "GitHub") Virtual clusters for better isolation than Namespace offers. OSS and Enterprise editions.
- __Logging__ : Cluster-level logging, AKA __Log Aggregation__ AKA __Unified Loggging__, so that logs survive their (ephemeral) generator, be that of any host or container process.
    - __Elastic stack__ : to collect, store, query, and visualize log data. 
        - Composed of:
            1. __Backend__ : [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html "Elastic.co") : A search &amp; analytics engine, with an integral storage scheme. Elasticsearch uses a __distributed document-oriented database model__ where it stores data in indices. These __indices are persisted__ to disk in a data directory, typically managed by Elasticsearch nodes. The storage and retrieval of data are handled internally by Elasticsearch using its own mechanisms, such as the [Lucene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Lucene "Wikipedia") library for indexing and searching.
            1. __Frontend__ : [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html "Elastic.co") frontend :  Web UI optimized for query/view &mdash;*Explore, Visualize, Discover* &mdash;logs from Elasticsearch.
            1. __Agent__ : Collector/Forwarder of container logs : This is the data-processing pipeline that ingests logs from applications, and then transform (normalize) and forwards them to provide for Unified Logging. This is __the stack's workhorse__, yet oddly external to the stack namesake and core (Elasticsearch/Kibana). Solutions are provided by various projects, many entirely separate from Elasticsearch (the company):
                - [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash "Elastic.co") : Elastic's native solution
                - [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/architecture "Fluentd.org") : Data collector (not limited to logs, metrics and tracing).
                    - [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) : 
                    *Lightweight forwarder for Fluentd* for environments having limited resources

        - [__AuthN__](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/ "Kubernetes.io") (Authentication)
            - __K8s__ 
                -  __Two types of subject__ : K8s provides for binding either type to roles for cluster access:
                    1. __`ServiceAccount`__ : K8s __object__ declaring a non-human entity (subject). E.g., a Pod.
                    1. A **user** and/or **group** : K8s __concept__ of human entity (subject).  
                    Though K8s has neither user nor group objects, 
                    it searches for these subjects in certificates and tokens, 
                    and provides for binding them to roles.
                - __Two scenarios__:
                    1. Clients authenticating against the K8s API server
                        - The **two most common methods**: 
                            - [X.509 certificate issued by K8s CA](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#normal-user "Kubernetes.io") 
                            - Token (JWTs) generated by an OIDC provider, e.g., __Dex__ or [__Keycloak__](file:///D:/1%20Data/IT/Container/Kubernetes/K8s-AD-integration-Keycloak.html "K8s-AD-integration-Keycloak"), which may proxy an upstream Identity Provider (__IdP__) such as AD. K8s [recognizes the subject](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/#request-attributes-used-in-authorization "Kubernetes.io"), e.g., by token claims of user/group, or  `ServiceAccount` having K8s `cluster.user`. 
                        - Regardless of method, __identities that match__ a (`Cluster`)`RoleBinding` __are authorized for access__ according to the associated (`Cluster`)`Role`.
                    1. Users authenticating at web UI against an application running on the cluster.
                        - Token (JWTs) generated by an OIDC provider, which may be same as other scenario, to enable Single Sign On (SSO), since OIDC is just an extention of [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/). 
                - [Authentication Plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#authentication-strategies "Kubernetes.io")
                    - Static Token file
                        - Bearer token
                        - Service Account token
                    - X.509 certificates (TLS)
                    - [Open ID Connect (OIDC) token](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/ "Kubernetes.io")

        Regardless of authentication method, 
        K8s can implement Role-based Access Control ([RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/ "Kubernetes.io")) model 
        against subjects ([known by request attribute(s)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/#request-attributes-used-in-authorization "Kubernetes.io"))
        using a pair of K8s objects for each of the two scopes of K8s API resources (`api-resources`):
            - __K8s__
                1. Namespaced (`Deployment`, `Pod`, `Service`, &hellip;)
                    - `Role` : Rules declaring the allowed actions (`verbs`) upon `resources` scoped to APIs (`apiGroup`).
                    - `RoleBinding` : Binding a subject (authenticated user or ServiceAccount) to a role.
                1. Cluster-wide (`PersistentVolume`, `StorageClass`, &hellip;)
                    - `ClusterRole`

        - [SPIFFE/SPIRE](https://spiffe.io/) : Successor to RBAC for __defining__ (SPIFFE) and __implementing__ (SPIRE) a __workload identity platform__ and access controls rooted in __Zero Trust__ (versus Perimeter Security) principles to mitigate attack risk. SPIFFE/SPIRE provides a __uniform identity layer across distributed systems__. The core idea is to issue   __SVIDs__ (SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Documents), of either __X.509__ or __JWT__, to workloads based on strong attestation (e.g., node identity, container metadata). __Tools__ like OPA, Istio, Linkerd, or Envoy with RBAC __consume SPIFFE IDs__ for authorization policies (__AuthZ__). So the same artifact (SVID) is used for both AuthN (proof of identity) and as _a handle for_ AuthZ rules.
            - __Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone__ (SPIFFE) : An OSS framework specificition to provide __attested, cryptographic identities__ to distributed workloads; capable of bootstrapping and issuing identity to services; defines short-lived cryptographic identity documents (__SVID__) via a simple API. Workloads use these SVIDs when authenticating to other workloads, for example by establishing a TLS connection or by signing and verifying a JWT token.
            - __SPIFFE Runtime Environment__ ([SPIRE](https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/spire-about/spire-concepts/)) : a production-ready implementation of the SPIFFE APIs (pluggable multi-factor attestation and SPIFFE federation) that performs __node and workload attestation__ in order to securely issue SVIDs to workloads, and verify the SVIDs of other workloads, based on a predefined set of conditions.

## Environments

__Upon what infrastructure__ does the app AKA workload AKA service run?

- __Cloud__ : 3rd-party vendor, typically virtual; SDNs, VMs, &hellip;
- __On-prem__ : Self managed; physical and/or virtual
- __Bare-metal__ : OS and app on physical machine, sans hypervisor/virtualization, 
  _regardless_ of whether on-prem or in cloud.
- __Edge__ : More than just a reference to gateway router(s); an environment and topology. 
  Distributed architectures and practices for __processing data closer to where it is generated or consumed__.
    - __Computing__: 
        - Proximal to Data : Located close to the source of data, such as IoT devices, sensors, or users. This proximity allows for faster data processing and reduced latency.
        - Distributed Architecture : Deploying smaller, localized data centers or computing resources that work together with centralized cloud services. This creates a distributed architecture where certain tasks are handled at the edge, while others are processed in the cloud or a central data center.
        - Real-Time Processing : For applications that require real-time processing and quick decision-making, such as autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and smart cities.
        - Reduced Bandwidth Usage : Only the relevant or processed data needs sent to central data center/cloud, reducing amount of data egress.
    - __Environment__:
        - Edge Devices : Sensors, IoT devices, smart appliances, &hellip;
            - To generate or consume data.
        - Edge Servers or Mini Data Centers : small-scale computing resources in retail stores, factories, telecom towers, vehicles, &hellip; deployed close to edge devices 
            - To process and analyze data locally.
        - Edge Gateways : Routers and other devices.
            - To aggregating data from various edge devices and sometimes perform initial processing before forwarding data to central servers or the cloud.

## Configuration 

- __Repository Structure__:  
    Organize your Git repository in a way that reflects your deployment environments and application structure. 
    This could involve separate directories for each environment and application.
- __Secrets Management__:  
    Use tools like [Bitnami Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets), 
    [SOPS](https://github.com/getsops/sops), 
    or [Vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault) for encrypting secrets that are stored in Git. 
    This ensures that sensitive information is securely managed.
- __Monitoring and Alerting__:  
    Integrate monitoring and alerting tools to track the health of your deployments and the Kubernetes cluster. 
    [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) 
    are commonly used tools that can be managed via GitOps.
- __Policy Enforcement__:  
    Use policy-as-code tools like Open Policy Agent (OPA) or [Kyverno](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno) 
    to enforce policies on your Kubernetes clusters. 
    Store policies in Git to apply them consistently across your environments.
- __Security Scanning__:  
    Implement security scanning of your Docker images and Kubernetes configurations as part of your CI/CD pipelines. 
    Tools like [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/ "trivy.dev"), Clair, and KubeLinter can be integrated into your workflows.

## Schemes for Unique Identifier

- [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) (Universally Unique Identifier):  
  A widely used 128-bit number that guarantees uniqueness across different systems, often used in databases and distributed systems; considered the standard for generating unique identifiers. [1, 2, 3]  
- NanoID:   
A compact, URL-friendly unique string generator with a similar collision probability to UUID, designed for JavaScript environments [1, 4, 5]  
- ULID (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier): A unique identifier that is also sortable, combining timestamp and randomness for efficient database indexing [1, 6]  
- CUID (Collision-resistant Unique Identifier): A unique identifier that incorporates a timestamp, counter, and random characters, designed for collision resistance in distributed systems [1, 5]  
- Snowflake ID: A unique identifier scheme often used in distributed databases, incorporating timestamps and sequence numbers to generate unique IDs [6, 7]  

### Key points to consider when choosing a unique identifier scheme: 

- __Collision probability__: How likely is it for two different identifiers to be the same. 
- Length and __readability__: How long is the identifier and __how easy is it to read__ and interpret. 
- __Sorting capabilities__: Whether the identifier can be __easily sorted in a database__ 
- Generation method: How the identifier is generated, __whether it uses randomness or timestamps__
