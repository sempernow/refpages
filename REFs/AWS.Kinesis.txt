Kinesis
=======
    Kinesis  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/introduction.html  
        Amazon's Kafka; handle real-time streaming data;    
        ingest/queue huge amounts of realtime 'messages' (small data),    
        from many sources, for (later/slower/distributed) processsing;  
        DISTRIBUTED STREAMING PLATFORM    

        alt: Apache Kafka  https://kafka.apache.org/    

        - Kinesis (Data) Streams  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html
            Ingest and store data streams for processing;  
            Shards (buffer) containing the realtime streaming data   
            - 1-500 shards (default limit @ US East/Wesst)  
            - Data capacity is sum of Shards' capacity  
            - Capacity per Shard  
                - 1 MB/blob max
                - Retention: 24 hrs (default) to 7 days    
                - Egress (Read):  1 MiB/record up to 2 MiB/s; 
                                  10 MiB/call; 10,000 records/call  
                - Ingest (Write): 1,000 PUT records/sec up to 1 MiB/s  
                                  500 records/request; 1 MiB/record up to 5 MiB/request

           Producers        =>  Kinesis Streams  =>  Consumers     =>  Storage  
           (EC2,Mobile,IoT)     (Shards)             (EC2 cluster)     (DynamoDB,S3,EMR,Redshift)  

        - Kinesis Video Streams  
            Ingest, durably store, encrypt, an dindex video streams for real-time and batch analytics; securely stream video from connected devices to AWS for analytics, machine learning (ML), playback, and other processing  

        - Kinesis Firehose  
            Fully automated/managed version of Kinesis Streams + Consumers  
            - immediately analyzed or stored  
           
           Producers  =>  Kinesis Firehose  =>  Storage  
                                                S3 => Redshift (in that order)  
                                                ElasticSearch-cluster  
                                                Splunk

        - Kinesis Analytics  
            Run standard SQL queries against data streams of Kinesis Streams|Firehose  

              Input                       =>  Kinesis Analytics  =>  Alerts/Storage 
              (Kinesis Streams|Firehose)                             (S3|Redshift|ElasticSearch-cluster)
