Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)

  replaces the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware interface originally present in all IBM PC-compatible personal computers,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface
  
GUID partition table (GPT) 

  a standard for partition table layout on a physical storage device, e,g., HDD and SSD, using globally unique identifiers (GUID); forms a part of UEFI standard; boot-loader and OS must be GPT-aware; uses Logical Block Addressing (LBA), like modern MBRs. also used on some BIOS systems because of the limitations of master boot record (MBR) partition tables, which use 32 bits for storing logical block addresses (LBA) and size information on a traditionally 512 byte disk sector.  
  
  The protective MBR is contained in LBA 0, the GPT header (Partition Table Header) is in LBA 1, and the GPT header has a pointer to the partition table, or Partition Entry Array, typically LBA 2. The UEFI specification stipulates that a minimum of 16,384 bytes, regardless of sector size, be allocated for the Partition Entry Array (LBA 2). On a disk having 512-byte sectors, a partition entry array size of 16,384 bytes and the minimum size of 128 bytes for each partition entry, LBA 34 is the first usable sector on the disk.

  - GPT allows 1 to 128 partitions.

  - Each GPT partition has max 18 exabytes (~18.8 million terabytes).

Remove the UEFI or BIOS boot files
==================================

  If you want a PC to only BOOT INTO a CERTAIN MODE, you can remove the files that Windows PE or Windows Setup use to boot in UEFI or BIOS mode. Remove the following files, depending on the mode you want to boot to.

  Boot only when in UEFI mode

    Remove the bootmgr file from the root of the Windows PE or Windows Setup media. 
    This prevents the device from starting in BIOS mode.
  
  Boot only when in BIOS mode

    Remove the efi folder from the root of the Windows PE or Windows Setup media. 
    This prevents the device from starting in UEFI mode.
