Get Partition Type (MBR|GPT)
============================
@ diskpart 
  DISKPART> list disk

    Disk ###  Status         Size     Free     Dyn  Gpt
    --------  -------------  -------  -------  ---  ---
    Disk 0    Online          111 GB  1024 KB
    Disk 1    Online         1863 GB  1024 KB
    Disk 2    Online           59 GB  1024 KB        * 
    
  If GPT, then "Gpt" collumn shows "*" (asterisk).
  So, e.g., above Disks 0 & 1 are both "MBR"; Disk 2 is "GPT". 

@ Device Manager (GUI)
  RIGHT-CLICK selected disk @ "Disk drives", then @ popup ...
  > Properties > Volumes > Populate 
  See "Partition style" value, e.g., "Master Boot Record (MBR)"

    Handled @ OS Install, but for DISM-applied method, must manually prepare by creating the necessary partitions, then applying source [wim] files by DISM, per partition.

        create partition EFI size=100|260  [512|4k]
        format quick fs=FAT32 label="System"
        assign letter="S"
        
      2. "Microsoft Reserved" (MSR)
        
        create partition MSR size=16
        
      3. "Windows"

        create partition primary

        gpt attributes=0x8000000000000001
        
        NOT necessary to set gpt attributes, which protect from access/removal. 
        
        CAN DELETE this Recovery Partition later, @ Windows Disk Management GUI, but only after 
        creating a USB recovery drive. 
        
        Create a (USB) recovery drive using Start Menu > "Create a recovery drive".
        May uncheck "Back up ..." to make smallest size. The process typically fails otherwise.
        
  System and Utility Partitions
  
    The first two partitions, EFI & MSR, are sometimes referred to by Microsoft as the SYSTEM PARTITIONS. By default, they do not appear in File Explorer. This helps protect end users from accidentally modifying a partition.

    Protect end users from accidentally modifying other partitions by IDENTIFYING them as UTILITY PARTITIONS. To set partitions as utility partitions:

    Diskpart.exe 

      list disk
      select disk 
      select partition 
      help gpt                            :: show gpt options 
      gpt attributes=0x0000000000000001   :: GPT_ATTRIBUTE_PLATFORM_REQUIRED 
                     0x8000000000000000   :: GPT_BASIC_DATA_ATTRIBUTE_NO_DRIVE_LETTER
                     0x4000000000000000   :: GPT_BASIC_DATA_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN
                     0x1000000000000000   :: GPT_BASIC_DATA_ATTRIBUTE_READ_ONLY

      select disk # <<< select # CAREFULLY !!!
      list disk     <<< shows "*" at selected disk
      clean
      convert MBR

        create partition primary size=100

        format fs=FAT32 label="System Reserved" quick
        assign letter=R

USB 
===
  MBR if Win 7  [PE]
  GPT if Win 10 [PE]
  
  MB vendors are more supportive of the FAT32 [vs NTFS] filesystem for either MBR or GPT -based disks; *vastly* so of their UEFI compliant firmware; even more so if disk is GPT-based.
  
  The USB setup process is to convert USB to mbr|gpt-based per 7|10, then partition, then either apply [wim] files by DISM, or mount+clone an ISO or other such [source] image.

  If ENTIRE disk available, and source is ISO, 
  then use Rufus, which will select GPT/MBR-based per OS-@-ISO info. 
  Else, ...
  
  # Win 7 or 10 [PE]
  
    Only 1 [FAT32] partition needed.

    @ diskpart
    
      list disk 
      select disk # <<< select # CAREFULLY !!!
      list disk  <<< shows "*" at selected disk
      clean
      convert mbr|gpt
          
      create partition primary
      select partition 1
      format fs=FAT32 label="WinPE" quick
      assign letter=K
      active

  NOTE: okay to SCRIPT diskpart.exe per "/s" ... 

    diskpart /s TXTFILE

    @ Boot Menu [F11 on boot]
     choose "USB ...", NOT "UEFI..."
     The latter causes infinite hang; pwr button off/on to exit.
