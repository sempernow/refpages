        <h1><a href="https://12factor.net/">The Twelve Factors</a></h1>

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://immutablewebapps.org/">Immutable Web Apps</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>I. <a href="https://12factor.net/codebase">Codebase</a></h2>

<p>One codebase per app and its many deploys (running instances).<br>
Versioned (<em>repo</em>); Dev, Test, Staging, Prod, ... <em>all share a root commit</em>.</p>

<h2>II. <a href="https://12factor.net/dependencies">Dependencies</a></h2>

<p>Explicitly <strong>declare</strong> and <strong>isolate</strong> dependencies per <em>dependency declaration manifest</em>;<br>
dependencies <em>scoped per app</em> (vendoring/bundling), not system-wide pkgs.<br>
Any required system (<code>bash</code>) tools (e.g., <code>curl</code>) are vendored into the app.</p>

<h2>III. <a href="https://12factor.net/config">Config</a></h2>

<p>Store (per deploy) configuration @ Env. Vars. (<code>env</code>);<br>
mutually orthogonal, language/OS agnostic.</p>

<h2>IV. <a href="https://12factor.net/backing-services">Backing services</a></h2>

<p>Loose coupling; treat backing services as attached resources;<br>
swappable sans app code change, only config change;<br>
accessed per URL or other locator/credentials stored in the config;<br>
app makes no distinction between local and third party services</p>

<h2>V. <a href="https://12factor.net/build-release-run">Stages: Build, Release, Run</a></h2>

<p>Strict separation between build and release stages.</p>

<ul>
<li>Build: transforms code repo into an executable bundle; a <em>build</em>.</li>
<li>Release: <code>ID = Build + Config</code>; immutable<br>
executable @ execution environment<br></li>
<li>Run (runtime): runs app @ execution environment; leanest stage;<br>
runs specified app process(es) against a selected app release.</li>
</ul>

<h2>VI. <a href="https://12factor.net/processes">Processes</a></h2>

<p>Execute the app as one or more stateless processes;<br>
each process is stateless and shares nothing.<br>
Stateful backing service(es) handle persistence.<br>
Process may utilize single-transaction cache.<br>
No sticky sessions; use time-expiration datastore (Memcached/Redis).<br>
Package assets during the build stage.</p>

<h2>VII. <a href="https://12factor.net/port-binding">Port binding</a></h2>

<p>Export services via port binding</p>

<p>App is completely self-contained; no runtime injection of a webserver;<br>
exports HTTP as a service by binding to a port,<br>
and listening to requests coming in on that port;<br>
one app can become the backing service for another app,<br>
whereof the backing app URL is declared in the config of consuming app.</p>

<h2>VIII. <a href="https://12factor.net/concurrency">Concurrency</a></h2>

<p>Scale out via the Unix process model (service daemons)</p>

<p>The share-nothing, horizontally partitionable nature of twelve-factor app processes<br>
means that adding more concurrency is a simple and reliable operation.</p>

<h2>IX. <a href="https://12factor.net/disposability">Disposability</a></h2>

<p>Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown;<br>
easier to move processes to new physical machines when warranted.</p>

<p>Processes shut down gracefully when they receive a SIGTERM signal from the process manager.</p>

<p>Processes should also be robust against sudden death, in the case of a failure in the underlying hardware.<br>
A recommended approach is use of a robust queueing backend;<br>
return jobs to the queue when clients disconnect or time out.</p>

<h2>X. <a href="https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity">Dev/Prod Parity</a></h2>

<p>Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible.<br>
Design for <a href="https://avc.com/2011/02/continuous-deployment/">Continuous Deployment</a>.</p>

<h2>XI. <a href="https://12factor.net/logs">Logs</a></h2>

<p>Treat logs as event streams</p>

<p>Logs provide visibility into the behavior of a running app; the stream of aggregated,<br>
time-ordered events collected from the output streams of all running processes and backing services;<br>
flow continuously as long as the app is operating.</p>

<p>Each running process writes its event stream, unbuffered, to stdout.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>@ development, can observe the app’s behavior.</p></li>

<li><p>@ staging or production deploys, each process’ stream is managed by the execution environment.<br>
Open-source log routers (Logplex/Fluentd) are available for this purpose.<br>
The event stream for an app can be routed to a file, or watched via realtime tail in a terminal.<br>
The stream can be sent to a log indexing and analysis system (Splunk), or warehoused (Hadoop/Hive).<br>
Allows for powerful/flexible introspecting an app’s behavior:</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>XII. <a href="https://12factor.net/admin-processes">Admin processes</a></h2>

<p>Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes</p>

<p>Languages which provide a REPL shell out of the box make this easy.</p>
