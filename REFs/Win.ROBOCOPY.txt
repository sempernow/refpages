ROBOCOPY.EXE :: Quirks/Bugs ...

* target folder attributes reset to source attributes regardless of any options.
	Solution: use _get_attrib.bat, _set_attrib.bat scripts.
	
* target file attribs reset to source regardless of `/COPY:DT` or `/A-:R` options.

* target purged regardless of no purge setting. Always test w/ `/NOCOPY` option first; rpt of "*Extra" means WILL delete target file(s).

* trailing backslash REQUIRED @ path[s] IF drive-root case [e.g., `d:\`]; 
  trailing backslash FORBIDDEN @ path[s] IF NOT drive-root case. 

* `/TIMFIX` triggers listing of ALL [unchanged] files on 1st-run of source/target synch/swap.

* `/MT` [multi-thread] triggers `100%` line appended to each reported target copy, regardless of `/NP` or any other option.

* `/FFT` [lower time-granularity] needed for USB drives to prevent unnecessary copy/update

* `/ZB` destroys LAN copy speed; nominally:77% GbE, but @ /ZB:3.5% GbE

* Symlink folders, "<SYMLINKD>",  may fail. Robocopy log will report "  *MISMATCH   -1 ..." 

Exit Codes
    0×00   0       No errors occurred, and no copying was done.
                   The source and destination directory trees are completely synchronized. 

    0×01   1       One or more files were copied successfully (that is, new files have arrived).

    0×02   2       Some Extra files or directories were detected. No files were copied
                   Examine the output log for details. 

    0×04   4       Some Mismatched files or directories were detected.
                   Examine the output log. Housekeeping might be required.

    0×08   8       Some files or directories could not be copied
                   (copy errors occurred and the retry limit was exceeded).
                   Check these errors further.

    0×10  16       Serious error. Robocopy did not copy any files.
