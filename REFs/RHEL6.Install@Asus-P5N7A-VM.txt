CentOS @ Asus-P5N7A-VM
======================

2016-12-20

	Use Rufus to make bootable install USB per downloaded ISO

	@ CentOS 7 :: no NIC driver 

		THE install issue is the network [NIC] driver. 

		If 'eth0' not installed/loaded on OS-install, then gone forever. 
		No way to install post OS-install; it's some magical/mystical driver install/load process, with a zillion unrelated suggestions for 'help' on the issue.
		The 'official' CentOS Documentation site ENDS @ CentOS-5.
	 
	@ CentOS 6.8  

		CentOS 6.8 is latest w/ drivers that install/load eth0;
		
			MUST have physical ethernet connection on boot/install.

	Tried CentOS-7, 64 bit [x86_64]

	CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-1511.iso 
	
	Downloaded per torrent @ ...
	
		http://mirrors.cat.pdx.edu/centos/7.2.1511/isos/x86_64/
	
	Installed, but no network; no drivers for anything.
	
	[Was NOT physically connected to router; try w/ connection @ install]
	
	Asus has only 32-bit linux drivers
	
		NVIDIA-Linux-x86-173.14.09-pkg1.run
	
	So, tried CentOS-6, 32-bit [i386]
	(CentOS 7, 32 bit unavailable per torrent)
	
		CentOS-6.8-i386-LiveCD.iso
		
		Downloaded per torrent @ ...
		
			http://mirrors.cat.pdx.edu/centos/6.8/isos/i386/
	
		Installed w/ connectivity !!! [eth0] 
		
		Was physically connected [ethernet] to router on install.
	

	Asus Linux [32-bit] drivers ... 
	
	Install per Readme @ Asus/Linux driver folder 
	
		cd <ydriver-directory>
		sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-173.14.09-pkg1.run
