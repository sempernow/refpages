__Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone__ (SPIFFE)

__SPIFFE__ is a set of open-source specifications for a framework 
capable of __bootstrapping and issuing identity to services across heterogeneous environments__ and organizational boundaries. 
The heart of these specifications is one defining short-lived cryptographic identity documents, 
"SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document" (__SVID__), and the API by which they are issued. 
Workloads use SVIDs when authenticating to other workloads, 
for example by establishing a TLS connection or by signing and verifying a JWT token.

A [__SPIRE__](https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/spire-about/spire-concepts/) server is a production-ready implementation 
of the __SPIFFE API__ that performs __node and workload attestation__ 
in order to securely issue SVIDs to workloads, and verify the SVIDs of other workloads, 
based on a predefined set of conditions.

* **Origin:** CNCF project, inspired by Google’s internal service identity system (Borg + Loas).
* **Purpose:** Issues **SPIFFE ID**s, which are **workload identities**, e.g., 
  __`spiffe://$trust_domain/$service_name`__, in the form of an **SVID** 
    - `X.509-SVID` 
    - `JWT-SVID`
* **Focus:**
    * Designed for *service-to-service authentication* in distributed systems, 
      including __zero-trust environments__.
    * No DNS-based proof. Instead of third-party, hierarchical trust, 
      proof of workload identity is done via __attestation plugins__ (K8s, AWS IAM, etc.).
    * __Certificates__ (SVIDs) are usually __short-lived__ (minutes to hours) 
      and signed by a __private CA__ inside the trust domain.



## [ACME Device Attestation](https://smallstep.com/platform/acme-device-attestation/index.html "smallstep.com") (__ACME-DA__) | [Article](https://smallstep.com/blog/acme-managed-device-attestation-explained/ "smallstep.com/blog")

ACME-DA is an **IETF draft extension to ACME** that adds a challenge type for **device identity** rather than **domain ownership**.
Instead of proving you control `example.com` (HTTP-01/DNS-01/TLS-ALPN-01), 
the client proves it *is* a specific hardware device, 
usually via something like TPM, Secure Enclave, or another hardware root of trust.


* **Origin:** ACME-DA is a successor to [Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8894 "IETF.org : RFC 8894"), 
which was originally designed for issuing X.509 certificates to network devices.
* **Purpose:** Automate issuing a certificate to a *device* without pre-provisioning secrets or relying on DNS ownership. 
  ACME-DA is especially useful in [Mobile Device Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device_management) (MDM);
  security software enabling organizations to secure, monitor, manage, 
  and enforce policies on employee-owned mobile devices; providing a secure 
  "Bring Your Own Device" (BYOD) environment to enterprises.
* **Challenge type:** `device-attest-01` (proposed).
* **Mechanism:**
    1. The device has a manufacturer-provisioned identity key + attestation cert (often in a TPM or secure element).
    2. ACME server sends a challenge.
    3. The device signs it using the key and returns an attestation statement (e.g., TPM quote, FIDO attestation).
    4. CA verifies this attestation against trusted manufacturer root certs.
    5. If valid, CA issues a certificate to that device.
* **Output:** Usually an __X.509__ certificate with identifiers tied to the device’s attested identity.

### **Relationship**

* ACME-DA is **closer in spirit** to SPIFFE/SPIRE than normal ACME is, 
  because both are about automating issuance based on **attestation**, not just DNS.
* In fact, you could imagine **SPIRE using ACME-DA** as an *upstream CA enrollment method* for its nodes or agents; 
  attesting a host once to get a bootstrap cert, then using SPIRE to issue short-lived workload certs.
* But **they’re not direct predecessors or replacements**:
    * ACME-DA is about *provisioning trust into a device* from a public or private CA based on hardware identity.
    * SPIFFE/SPIRE is about *distributing and rotating trust inside a running environment* based on workload identity.
