	Depending on the server configuration, it's possible for other connection parameters to fail to negotiate. You might find the Ciphers and/or MACs configuration options useful for enabling these. It's also possible to query which algorithms ssh supports:

	ssh -Q cipher       # List supported ciphers
	ssh -Q mac          # List supported MACs
	ssh -Q key          # List supported public key types
	ssh -Q kex          # List supported key exchange algorithms

	Finally, it's also possible to query the configuration that ssh is actually using when attempting to connect to a specific host, by using the -G option:

	ssh -G user@somehost.example.com

WiFi Bridge Mode
----------------

	Router used as wireless bridge to the Gateway router's LAN; physically extends LAN to another area, wirelessly. Most effective for wired clients at [remote] bridge, else the double-WiFi-hop to base-station halves the effective speed.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridging_(networking)

	dd-wrt Wiki :: Client Bridge  

		http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Client_Bridged

	@ Primary/Gateway router ...
	
	- Get WiFi info of Gateway [main] Router
		- SSID
		- Security info 
			- mode (WEP/WPA2/WPA2-PSK)
			- key
		- Operating frequency info (2.4 and 5 GHz)
			
	@ Client Bridge [CB] router ...
	
		Primary and CB routers must be on same subnet 

 			if Primary router IP is ...  192.168.A.X 
			then CB router needs IP of   192.168.A.Z

			So, each set @ router [self]
			
				Gateway @       192.168.1.1
				Client-Bridge @ 192.168.1.2  [OUTSIDE Gateway's DHCP-served range]

	- ADVANCED > Advanced Setup > Wireless Settings


		- Enable Bridge Mode
		
			- Get IP Address Dynamically 
			- Get DNS Server Address Dynamically
			- Select same security mode as at Gateway Router

			... note here the 'Dynamically' refers to hosts/clients of this client-bridge router.
			
		- Set Wireless Security to 'WPA2 Personal'
		
		- Set same wireless info/settings used by the Gateway [main] router.
