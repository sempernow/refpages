# Win10 Update (live) using the install ISO

1. __Mount it__ (from a location that survives reboots): 
    - RT-CLICK the ISO file > "Open with" > "Windows Explorer"
1. __Run `Setup.exe`__
    - "Change how &hellip;" > "__Not right now__" (check box)
    - Next (button)
    - "Change what to keep" 
        - Can leave unchanged; however, at ___version 1903___, this results in a ___reset___ of many OS configurations ___back to their default___; folder views, SendTo endpoints, shortcut (name and icon-overlay), &hellip;. 
        - TODO: find what is changeable; find PowerShell script to handle this.
