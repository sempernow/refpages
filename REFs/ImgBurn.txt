					Use 2x filesize of etfsboot.com

ImgBurn > Advanced > Bootable Disc 

	* Select "Make Image Bootable"
	
	* Select "Extract Boot Image"

	- Choose source, e.g., Windows Install Disk [iso or DVD].
	
	- Select SAVE [icon/button].
	
	- Select a [temp/working] destination for boot-image file [BootImage.ima ~ 4 KB].
	
		This extracts the appropriate "boot image" file.
		
	- Select "yes" to "use" it in this "project" [new pop-up @ v.2.5.8.0].
	
		This will capture/auto-set all those mysterious parameters [above the "Extract Boot Image" button] required to make the target [CD/DVD] bootable.  

	
This is how the Win7Ult.SP1.64-bit install DVD was created. Boot-image source was the downloaded Win7...-install iso file, mounted using Virtual CloneDrive.
