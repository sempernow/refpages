Test-driven Development (TDD)

	- Write a test. (First!)
	- Write minimal amount of code to make the compiler pass, but the test fail.
	- Run the test, see that it fails and check the error message is meaningful
	- Write enough code to make the test pass
	- Refactor

A strict discipline for creating modular, well-designed and testable code without doing any upfront design. It achieves this by making you WORK IN EXTREMELY SHORT CYCLES: create an automated test, write the minimum amount of code to satisfy that test, and refactor your code to improve the quality. This approach ensures a few nice properties of the resulting code:
