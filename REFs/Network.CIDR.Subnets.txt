# CIDR Notation

    Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), 
    is an IP addressing scheme for subnets that replaces 
    the older (1981-1993) system based on 
    [classes A, B, C, D and E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network).

    A CIDR defines the subnet's IP address range, the network part (Netmask) shared by all subnet addresses (hosts), 
    and the host part (Wildcard) that is unique. The CIDR has two values. 
    First is the first IP address of its range. Second, after the slash, is the number of bits in the Netmask. 
    The more bits in the mask, the fewer IP addresses (hosts) for the subject subnet. 
    E.g., `192.168.0.100/32` is a single IP address.


    |CIDR         |IP Address Range           |Netmask    |Wildcard    |Hosts    |
    |-------------|---------------------------|-----------|------------|---------|
    |10.10.0.0/16 |10.10.0.0 - 10.10.255.255  |255.255.0.0|0.0.255.255 |65,536   |
    |172.16.0.0/12|172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255|255.240.0.0|0.15.255.255|1,048,576|

    |Class|CIDR        |
    |-----|------------|
    |A    |0.0.0.0/8   |
    |B    |128.0.0.0/16|
    |C    |192.0.0.0/24|
    |D    |224.0.0.0/4 | (Multicast)
    |E    |240.0.0.0/? | (Reserved)

    3. Private Address Space

       The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the
       following three blocks of the IP address space for private internets:

         10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix)
         172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix)
         192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)


# TCP/IP Subnet Addressing

    Subnet is a range of IP addresses in a network;    
    IP Address is typically a DECIMAL REPRESENTATION thereof; 
    DOT NOTATION: a 32 bit binary number separated into four sets of bytes (octets); DECIMAL <==> BINARY  
    {0-255}.{0-255}.{0-255}.{0-255}  <==>  {00000000-11111111}.{00000000-11111111}....   

    SUBNET  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html
        CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing); 1993  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing 
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#IPv4_CIDR_blocks   
            A method for allocating IP addresses and IP routing;  
            IPv4 CIDR BLOCK range notation: ADDR.ADDR.ADDR.ADDR/BITS  (all in DECIMAL) 

            SUBNET MASK (`/dd`) a.k.a. NETMASK; the NUMBER OF BITS in the NETWORK ADDRESS, in DECIMAL 
                ON (1)  bits represent NETWORK  
                OFF (0) bits represent HOSTS (allowable nodes on the subnet)   

                E.g., '/20', a 20 bit (8+8+4) NETMASK
                    11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000  <==>  FF.FF.F0.00  <==>  255.255.240.0
                    |<------ 20 -------->|< --- 12 -->|

            WILDCARD MASK; bit-inverted subnet mask; bits NOT of the Nework ID; those for host addresses
                E.g., '/20' has 12 (32-20) WILDCARD BITS; 4,096 (2^12) host addresses:
                    00000000.00000000.00001111.11111111  <==>  00.00.0F.FF  <==>  0.0.15.255
                I.e., a 12 bit Wildcard Mask.

            E.g., 172.31.32.0/20  
                Calculate # Hosts: 2^(32-20) => 2^12 = 4,096
                Calculate Netmask: 20 = 16+4 => 255.255.(255-(4 bits)); Address range 
                of 4 bits, 2^4=16, is 0-15 => 255 - 15 = 240 
                    Subnet Mask: 255.255.240.0
                    Wildcard Bits:  0.0.15.255 (bit-inverted mask)
                So, host address range is 172.31.32.0 - 172.31.47.255; 4,096 addresse

            - Class scheme is from 1981-1993; pre CIDR; less efficient allocation; lingers @ default subnet addr 
            - Though Classless, CIDR Block addressing having default/standard subnet masks may be referred to as CLASSFUL.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network#Classful_addressing_definition
