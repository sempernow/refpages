		  * only by DFS [Dynamic Frequency Selection]
		
	- Config @ Advanced/Wireless Setup Menu

	- Always assign static IPs to network infrastructure nodes -- repeaters, bridges, etc --and set it to and address OUTSIDE THE RANGE served by the DHCP server, but having same Network ID [same subnet mask].
          
          
ROUTER MODES
============

	AP mode
	-------

		Router used as Access Point [AP] only.
		
		- Connect the WAN port at [W]AP router to any LAN port at Gateway [main] router
		
		- ADVANCED > Advanced Setup > Wireless Settings
		
			- Select/Enable [Wireless] AP mode
		
				This should turn off DHCP & DNS functions.
			
			- IP Address setting; Get dynamically from Gateway [main] router
		
		
	WiFi Bridge/Repeater modes
	--------------------------

		Wireless Access Point (WAP) modes; Vendor/chipset specific parameters/config. 
		
			- Wireless bridging
			
				WAPs communicate only with each other; don't allow client access.
			
			- Wireless repeating
			
				WAPs communicate with each other and with wireless clients.
				Wireless throughput is reduced by at least 50%.
	
		Either may be referred to as 'WiFi Distribution System' [WDS] by router vendors; router manuals may use either term [bridge/repeater/WDS] to describe their implementation of some mix of such functionality.

		May NOT provide seamless roaming to wireless clients. Also, wireless clients of WDS [bridge] have only half its original wireless speed due to the required two wireless hops; WiFi is inherently half-duplex; TX or RX, but NOT both simultaneously. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_distribution_system
			
		
		WiFi Bridge Mode
		----------------

			Router used as wireless bridge to the Gateway router's LAN; physically extends LAN to another area, wirelessly. Most effective for wired clients at [remote] bridge, else the double-WiFi-hop to base-station halves the effective speed.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridging_(networking)
		
			@ Gateway [main] router ...
			
			- Get WiFi info of Gateway [main] Router
				- SSID
				- Security info 
					- mode (WEP/WPA2/WPA2-PSK)
					- password
				- Operating frequency info (2.4 and 5 GHz)
					
			@ Bridge router ...
			
			- ADVANCED > Advanced Setup > Wireless Settings
			
				- Enable Bridge Mode
				
					- Get IP Address Dynamically
					- Get DNS Server Address Dynamically
					- Select same security mode as at Gateway Router
					
				- Set Wireless Security to WPA2-PSK
				
				- Set same wireless info/settings used by the Gateway [main] router.
				

		 WiFi Distribution System [WDS] [WiFi Base + Repeater Stations]
		---------------------------------------------------------------
		
			Router acts as a TX/RX repeater station [only]. Extends WiFi range of Base Station [a.k.a. Gateway, a.k.a. main] router. The double-WiFi-hop, client-to-repeater and repeater-to-base-station, halves the effective speed.  http://www.tomsguide.com/us/how-to-wds-bridge,review-253-2.html
		
			- Get Info 
			
				- Wireless MAC[s] of Base Station & Repeater[s]
				
					For 'active' WDS, which is detailed here, each router [base and repeater] must know the other's MAC; this is vendor/chipset specific. Some vendors/chipsets can be configured for 'passive' WDS, where only the repeater is configured, leaving the base-station config untouched.
				
			- Base Station Setup [BEFORE repeater-station setup]
			
				- Disable Wireless Security for the band used as repeater [use 5 GHz band].

				- ADVANCED > Advanced Setup > Wireless Repeating
				
					- Enable Wireless Repeating; 'Wireless Base Station' function (5GHz a/n/ac)
					
					- Disable Wireless Client Association; provides security; prevents WiFi clients from associating with the repeater; allowing LAN client associations only.
				
					- Enter Repeater MAC Address
				
			- Repeater Station Setup [AFTER base-station setup]
			
				- Disable Wireless Security for the band used as repeater [use 5 GHz band].

				- ADVANCED > Advanced Setup > Wireless Repeating
			
					- Enable Wireless Repeating; 'Wireless Repeater' Function (5GHz a/n/ac)
					
					- Enter [set] this Repeater router's IP Address; must be same subnet, but different address, of Base Station router. E.g., if Base Station IP is 192.168.1.1, set this repeater's IP to 192.168.1.99
					
					- Disable Wireless Client Association; provides security; prevents WiFi clients from associating with the repeater; allowing LAN client associations only.
