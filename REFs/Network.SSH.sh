            ssh -T -i ~/.ssh/gitlab git@gitlab.com # -T to DISABLE tty/pty allocation.
            ## Manage per-host connections DECLARATIVELY at ~/.ssh/config : man ssh_config

                        # By running the SOCKS proxy on the jump box, 
                        # the back-end data stores remain isolated 
                        # and their exposure to the network is minimized. 
                        # This configuration helps in maintaining the principle of least privilege, 
                        # reducing the attack surface by not adding additional services on the data store servers themselves.
                    # - Ease of Management: 
                        # Managing network configurations, access rules, and monitoring on a single jump box is simpler and more secure 
                        # than managing these settings across multiple back-end servers. 
                        # This setup also makes it easier to enforce consistent security policies and to audit access logs.
                    # - Flexibility and Efficiency: 
                        # The jump box can handle requests from multiple back-end servers in a centralized manner, 
                        # making network management more efficient. It also simplifies the network architecture by avoiding the need for each back-end server 
                        # to run its own instance of the proxy software.
