
Broken sudo @ CentOS machine ...

  PROBLEM: 

    $ sudo COMMAND  # does not execute; err msg ...

    "USERNAME is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported."

  SOLUTION: 
  
    Boot into Recovery Environment and add USERNAME to "wheel" group  

        @ GRUB menu > select second option; 'recovery' or something like that.
        @ GUI menu > mouse-clicked on 'other user' or something like that
        @ Login as root

            # Add user to wheel group
            $ usermod -aG wheel USERNAME  

        Test by switching to that user:

            $ su - USERNAME
            # List root dir:
            $ sudo ls -la /root
            ... prompts for password ... 

            Works !!!

            # Try as regular user (USERNAME) ...
            $ ls -la /root 
            ... permission denied.

How To Create a Sudo User on CentOS [Quickstart] 
  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-sudo-user-on-centos-quickstart

  Introduction

  The sudo command provides a mechanism for granting administrator privileges, ordinarily only available to the root user, to normal users. This guide will show you the easiest way to create a new user with sudo access on CentOS, without having to modify your server's sudoers file. If you want to configure sudo for an existing user, simply skip to step 3.

  Steps to Create a New Sudo User

    Log in to your server as the root user.

      ssh root@server_ip_address

    Use the adduser command to add a new user to your system.

    Be sure to replace username with the user that you want to create.

      adduser username

      Use the passwd command to update the new user's password.

        passwd username

      Set and confirm the new user's password at the prompt. A strong password is highly recommended!

      Set password prompts:
      Changing password for user username.
      New password:
      Retype new password:
      passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.

    Use the usermod command to add the user to the wheel group.

      usermod -aG wheel username

    By default, on CentOS, members of the wheel group have sudo privileges.

    Test sudo access on new user account

      Use the su command to switch to the new user account.

        su - username

      As the new user, verify that you can use sudo by prepending "sudo" to the command that you want to run with superuser privileges.

        sudo command_to_run

      For example, you can list the contents of the /root directory, which is normally only accessible to the root user.

        sudo ls -la /root

      The first time you use sudo in a session, you will be prompted for the password of the user account. Enter the password to proceed.

      Output:
      [sudo] password for username:

      If your user is in the proper group and you entered the password correctly, the command that you issued with sudo should run with root privileges.
    
    

Broken sudo
-----------

PROBLEM: 

  sudo <command> # does not execute; err msg ...

  "<USERNAME> is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported."

SOLUTION:

  @ boot, press the Shift key for a few seconds to get the Grub boot menu. 

  @ Grub boot menu ...

    "Advanced options ..."

      “recovery mode”    
      
      ... which mounts filesystem as read-only, so 
      changes can't be saved, in that state.

  @ Recovery menu ...

    “root     Drop to root shell prompt”

  @ shell ... change state ... mount fs as read-write

    mount -o rw,remount /  

    
  CASE 1 :: if user not in sudo or admin group
      
    adduser <USERNAME> sudo

    adduser <USERNAME> admin
      
  CASE 2 ::  /etc/sudoers file altered to prevent users in sudo or admin group from elevating their privileges to that of a super user

    cp /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.orginal 
    
    visudo 
    
    #
    # This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
    #
    # Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of
    # directly modifying this file.
    #
    # See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.

    %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
    # See sudoers(5) for more information on "#include" directives:
    #includedir /etc/sudoers.d    
  
  CASE 3 :: Setting Correct Permission on sudoers File
  
    chmod  0440  /etc/sudoers
  
  
  Then ...
  
  exit
  
  @ Recovery menu ... select from menu ...
  
  "resume   Resume normal boot"

Else try ...

  Connect as 'user' then do 'su -' and the root password to become root. 
  
  usermod -aG wheel

  Follow this procedure to create a normal user account and give it sudo access

  # Run the visudo to edit the /etc/sudoers file. This file defines the policies applied by the sudo command.
  
    visudo 

    ## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
    %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       ALL  # make sure this line is uncommented   

  # Add the user you created to the wheel group using the usermod command.

    usermod -aG wheel <USERNAME>

  # Test that the updated configuration allows the user you created to run commands using sudo.
    
    # Use the su to switch to the new user account that you created.

      # above command outputs ... 
      
        We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

          #1) Respect the privacy of others.
          #2) Think before you type.
          #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

        [sudo] password for <USERNAME>:
        root
    
      # The last line of the output is the user name returned by the whoami command. If sudo is configured correctly this value will be root.

  Adding a user to your Root Wheel

  First you need to exit the current user so..
  >exit 
  Then from the Login prompt log into root.
  Login > root
  Password?

  Now that you are root move to the directory /etc/ Here you are going to be editing the group. So..
  >cd /etc/ 
  >vi group Group contains which users can do what. For example:

  If you did not have your user in the wheel, you wouldn't be able to su to root. So adding users to particular apps or deamons is important. So to add a user, add like such.
