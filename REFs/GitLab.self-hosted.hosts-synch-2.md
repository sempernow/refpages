# [GitLab : Synch Projects Between Air-gap Networks](https://chatgpt.com/share/67bd002b-c7e8-8009-8427-44e4223e1481)

# Q:

What is the advised __Group structure__ for GitLab self-hosted when software development projects on its private domain are those of same on another private domain, with recurring updates, and the two domains are air gapped?

# A:

For your **GitLab self-hosted** setup with **two air-gapped private domains** that share the **same software development projects** with **recurring updates**, the **GitLab Group structure** should be designed to ensure:

- **Clear separation of concerns** between domains.
- **Efficient synchronization** between the two air-gapped environments.
- **Granular access control** for teams and users.
- **Scalability** for future project growth.

### **Recommended Group Structure**

#### **1. Top-Level Groups per Domain**
Create a **top-level group** for each air-gapped domain:
```
/DomainA
/DomainB
```
Each group represents one private domain's GitLab environment. This structure keeps administrative control separate between domains.

#### **2. Mirrored Subgroups for Software Projects**
Under each top-level group, create **identically structured subgroups** that mirror each other. For example:
```
/DomainA/SoftwareX
/DomainA/SoftwareY
/DomainB/SoftwareX
/DomainB/SoftwareY
```
Each subgroup represents a **specific software** that exists in both domains.

#### **3. Repository-Level Project Syncing**
Each software subgroup contains the actual repositories, such as:
```
/DomainA/SoftwareX/frontend
/DomainA/SoftwareX/backend
/DomainB/SoftwareX/frontend
/DomainB/SoftwareX/backend
```
This structure ensures that repositories stay **identically structured** between the two air-gapped environments, simplifying syncing and automation.

#### **4. Special Synchronization Group (Optional)**
If synchronization between the two domains is manual or handled via scripts, consider a **dedicated synchronization group**:
```
/SyncPipeline
```
This can contain:
- Repositories for **scripts** that handle export/import of code updates.
- **Documentation** related to the air-gapped transfer process.
- **Monitoring tools** to track version consistency between environments.

---

### **Synchronization Between Domains**
Since the domains are air-gapped, you need a **manual or semi-automated process** for transferring updates:

1. **Export from Domain A**
   - Use `git bundle` or a GitLab repository export.
   - Export metadata such as merge requests (if needed).

2. **Transfer to Domain B**
   - Physically transfer via USB, air-gapped transfer server, or secure file-sharing method.
   - Import into GitLab on Domain B.

3. **Validation**
   - Check the integrity of the transferred repositories.
   - Run automated tests to ensure consistency.

4. **Merge and Deploy**
   - Merge updates into Domain B's repositories.
   - Deploy as needed.

---

### **User & Access Management**
- Use **group-level access controls** to separate developers, maintainers, and administrators within each domain.
- Assign **mirrored roles** for users in both domains to maintain consistency.
- Consider **SSO or LDAP integration** if authentication needs to be centrally managed per domain.

---

### **Key Benefits of This Structure**
âœ… **Consistency** between domains despite air-gapping.  
âœ… **Scalability** for additional projects without restructuring.  
âœ… **Granular security** via GitLabâ€™s **group and project-level permissions**.  
âœ… **Easier synchronization** using mirrored structures.

Would you like recommendations for automating the synchronization process between the air-gapped environments?

# Q:

Some have argued that since Git is distributed, having dual repos per project is not justified; that it can and should be handled by git processes like merge.

# A:

While Gitâ€™s distributed model works great in a connected world, an air-gapped environment introduces constraints that require a structured GitLab-based synchronization process.

### **Counterargument: Why Dual GitLab Repos Per Project are Justified in an Air-Gapped Environment**  

You're absolutely right that **Git is inherently distributed**, allowing developers to work with multiple remotes and branches rather than maintaining two separate GitLab repositories per project. However, in the case of **air-gapped networks**, the typical Git workflowsâ€”such as merging changes from a remote repositoryâ€”face **significant challenges** due to the lack of direct network access.  

Below are **key reasons** why keeping separate GitLab repositories (one per air-gapped domain) **is justified**:

---

## **1. Air-Gapped Constraints Prevent Direct Git Merge Workflows**
### **How Git Normally Handles Multi-Environment Collaboration**
In a standard Git setup, developers would:
- Clone a shared remote repository.
- Fetch and merge branches from the same upstream.
- Push changes to a common repository.

### **Why This Doesn't Work in an Air-Gapped Setup**
- **No direct access to a shared Git server** â†’ Fetching and merging requires an internet or network connection between environments, which does not exist in air-gapped networks.
- **Manual transfers are required** â†’ You canâ€™t `git pull` from an air-gapped network; updates must be physically transferred (e.g., via USB or dedicated transfer hosts).

Because there is **no common remote repository**, keeping **two GitLab repositories** (one per domain) **mimics** the behavior of a single shared remote but allows synchronization via controlled transfers.

---

## **2. Security and Compliance Considerations**
Many air-gapped environments exist **for regulatory, security, or classified purposes** (e.g., defense contractors, industrial control systems, financial institutions).  
 
- **A single Git repository spanning two domains would violate security policies** if unauthorized data flows between them.
- **Air-gapped transfers are typically subject to review and approval** â†’ Even if you could script Git fetches, changes require security clearance.
- **Forensic tracking and change management need to be separate** â†’ Auditors often require a clear log of what was transferred and approved.

Keeping separate GitLab repositories **ensures strict security and governance policies** are followed when moving code across domains.

---

## **3. Avoiding Cross-Environment Merge Conflicts and Pollution**
Gitâ€™s distributed nature **assumes an open flow of commits**, but in an air-gapped setup, repositories evolve **independently**, often in **different timeframes**.

- **Domain A may apply security patches first** â†’ If developers merge and push back to Domain B **without synchronization policies**, they could overwrite necessary changes.
- **Domain B may introduce environment-specific changes** â†’ Hardcoded configurations, deployment scripts, or access policies differ between domains.
- **Merging without controlled synchronization can break both environments** â†’ Developers need to control **when** and **how** updates get merged.

By having **separate GitLab repositories**, each environment can **stabilize** updates before syncing, preventing **environment-specific issues** from leaking across domains.

---

## **4. Maintaining an Organized, Repeatable Sync Process**
Git is flexible, but **a structured GitLab-based approach ensures repeatability**:

| Workflow  | Pure Git Approach  | Dual GitLab Repos Approach |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Synchronization**  | Manual `git format-patch` & `git am` per repo  | Automated GitLab-based import/export using `git bundle`  |
| **Metadata Transfer**  | Requires custom scripts to move issues & MRs | GitLab API handles metadata syncing |
| **Security Controls** | Requires strict ACLs per Git remote  | Each GitLab repo enforces separate policies |
| **Air-Gap Compliance** | No inherent controls in `git push`  | GitLab project approval workflows ensure compliance |

Having **dual GitLab repositories** helps maintain an **automated, repeatable, and secure** process **without requiring direct network connectivity**.

---

## **5. Practical Experience from Air-Gapped Environments**
Many organizations already **follow this structure** in air-gapped setups:

1. **US DoD & Defense Contractors**  
   - Maintain separate repositories for **classified** and **unclassified** networks.
   - Code must be reviewed before being **manually transferred between domains**.

2. **Financial Institutions (e.g., Banks, Insurance Companies)**  
   - Keep **internal GitLab repos separate** from vendor-controlled repos.
   - Transfers happen through **compliance-reviewed air-gap processes**.

3. **Industrial Control Systems (ICS/SCADA)**  
   - IT (Internet-connected) and OT (Operational, air-gapped) environments **do not share repositories directly**.
   - All updates must be **signed, reviewed, and manually imported**.

Each of these industries **could use a single Git repository in theory, but operational security requires dual repositories**.

---

## **Conclusion: Git Alone is Not Enough in an Air-Gapped Setup**

While Gitâ€™s distributed model **works great in a connected world**, an **air-gapped environment introduces constraints** that require a structured **GitLab-based synchronization process**.  

**Key Takeaways**:
âœ… **Separate GitLab repositories ensure compliance with air-gap security policies.**  
âœ… **GitLab-based sync workflows prevent accidental overwrite and maintain control over merges.**  
âœ… **Environment-specific changes and delays in patching require controlled synchronization.**  
âœ… **An air-gapped sync process using GitLab tools is easier to automate than raw Git workflows.**  

ðŸ‘‰ **For non-air-gapped setups, a single Git repository makes sense.**  
ðŸ‘‰ **For air-gapped domains, dual GitLab repositories are the best practice.**  

# Q:

Mismatches of GroupX/.../ProjectY paths between Domains A and B are handled simply at git remote add origin ... ?

# A:

### **Handling Mismatches in GitLab Group Paths Between Air-Gapped Domains**  

Yes, **mismatches in repository paths between Domain A and Domain B** can be handled **at the `git remote add origin ...` level** when syncing repositories across air-gapped environments.  

However, you need to **carefully map paths** between the two domains to **avoid breaking synchronization workflows**.  

---

## **1. Simple Path Mapping at `git remote add origin`**
If **Group paths differ** but **Project names remain the same**, you can manually adjust the remote URL when syncing.

### **Example: Different GitLab Group Paths**
| Domain  | Path Structure |
|---------|---------------|
| **Domain A**  | `/SoftwareA/BackendProject.git` |
| **Domain B**  | `/Infrastructure/Backend.git` |

### **How to Handle This in Git**
On **Domain A**:
```bash
git clone --mirror https://git.domainA.lan/SoftwareA/BackendProject.git
cd BackendProject.git
git bundle create backend.bundle --all
```
Move the `backend.bundle` file **to Domain B** via USB or a secure offline method.

On **Domain B**, restore the repository with a different path:
```bash
git clone --mirror backend.bundle Backend.git
cd Backend.git
git remote add origin https://git.domainB.lan/Infrastructure/Backend.git
git push --mirror origin
```
This effectively **re-maps the project** from `/SoftwareA/BackendProject` on Domain A to `/Infrastructure/Backend` on Domain B.

---

## **2. Handling Path Differences Across Multiple Repositories**
For **multiple repositories**, you can automate the remapping using a script.

### **Mapping Config File (`repo_mapping.txt`)**
```
# Format: SourceRepo,TargetRepo
SoftwareA/BackendProject,Infrastructure/Backend
SoftwareA/FrontendProject,Infrastructure/Frontend
```

### **Automated Transfer Script**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

DOMAIN_A="git.domainA.lan"
DOMAIN_B="git.domainB.lan"
TRANSFER_DIR="/transfer"

mkdir -p $TRANSFER_DIR

while IFS=',' read -r SOURCE_REPO TARGET_REPO; do
    echo "Exporting $SOURCE_REPO..."
    git clone --mirror "https://$DOMAIN_A/$SOURCE_REPO.git" "$TRANSFER_DIR/$SOURCE_REPO.git"
    cd "$TRANSFER_DIR/$SOURCE_REPO.git"
    git bundle create "$TRANSFER_DIR/$TARGET_REPO.bundle" --all
    cd -
done < repo_mapping.txt

echo "Transfer the bundles manually, then run the import script on Domain B."
```

### **Import Script on Domain B**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

DOMAIN_B="git.domainB.lan"
TRANSFER_DIR="/transfer"

while IFS=',' read -r SOURCE_REPO TARGET_REPO; do
    echo "Importing $TARGET_REPO..."
    git clone --mirror "$TRANSFER_DIR/$TARGET_REPO.bundle" "$TARGET_REPO.git"
    cd "$TARGET_REPO.git"
    git remote add origin "https://$DOMAIN_B/$TARGET_REPO.git"
    git push --mirror origin
    cd -
done < repo_mapping.txt
```

This script ensures:
âœ… **Repository paths are automatically remapped.**  
âœ… **Human error is reduced in the transfer process.**  
âœ… **Multiple repositories can be synced in bulk.**

---

## **3. Handling Group and Namespace Renaming at GitLab Level**
If renaming paths at `git remote add origin` isn't ideal, **another approach** is to modify GitLab **namespaces** on the receiving domain.

### **Method 1: Rename GitLab Groups on Domain B**
- If you **control** Domain Bâ€™s GitLab instance, you can **rename groups** to match Domain A.
- In **GitLab UI**, go to:
  ```
  GitLab â†’ Groups â†’ Edit Group â†’ Change Group Path
  ```
- This keeps repository URLs identical and avoids remapping.

### **Method 2: Use GitLab Repository Mirroring (If Allowed)**
- If **a temporary network connection** exists between Domain A and B, GitLabâ€™s **pull mirroring** can sync repositories **even if paths differ**.
- Set up a **push mirror on Domain A** or a **pull mirror on Domain B**, adjusting repository paths accordingly.

---

## **4. Special Case: If Only Project Names Differ**
If **Group paths are the same**, but **Project names differ**, the process is still simple.

| Domain  | Repository Path |
|---------|---------------|
| **Domain A**  | `/SoftwareX/Backend.git` |
| **Domain B**  | `/SoftwareX/BackendAPI.git` |

You can still handle this via:
```bash
git clone --mirror https://git.domainA.lan/SoftwareX/Backend.git
cd Backend.git
git remote add origin https://git.domainB.lan/SoftwareX/BackendAPI.git
git push --mirror origin
```
This maps `Backend` (Domain A) â†’ `BackendAPI` (Domain B).

---

## **Final Thoughts**
âœ… **Yes, mismatches in repository paths between domains can be handled via `git remote add origin ...`.**  
âœ… **For multiple repositories, an automated mapping script ensures consistency.**  
âœ… **If managing GitLab instances, renaming groups or using mirroring can be alternatives.**  


# Q : 

Ansible Playbook that:

- Exports repositories from __DomainA__ (GitLab __Source__).
- Transfers the `.bundle` files to a manually mounted directory (`/mnt/usb` or another secure transfer medium).
- Imports repositories into __DomainB__ (GitLab __Destination__).
- Handles different repository paths between the two domains.
