* USB app; SAMBA server allows no drive-root access. Also, network device-name, e.g., 'SMB', is set/same for BOTH ports. That is, USB#1 & USB#2, are both seen by network under '\\SMB'; all first-child folders of both drives share the same namespace, e.g., '\\SMB\foo'.

* WPS button; when set to toggle Wireless Radio power, requires press-and-hold for a second or two.

* Disabling WAN connection loses everything; nothing stored/recovered. Initialization process may fail in many ways.

* AiCloud screws you seven ways from Sunday ...

		Settings have been updated. Web page will now refresh.
		Changes have been made to the IP address or port number. You will now be disconnected from RT-AC66U.
		To access the settings of RT-AC66U, reconnect to the wireless network and use the updated IP address and port number.

		Recovery: Was able to get Web logon by power off of everything, and then connecting Router to Cable Modem, exclusively. From there, restarted WAN connection. 


OEM Firmware [3.0.0.4.376_1123] Issues
--------------------------------------
* WPS button set to "Toggle Radio" does not work, regardless of selection and regardless of WPS "ON"/"OFF"

	Fix: 	None.
	
* User Guide [2013] doesn't match selections available @ Web UI/Admin [firmware v.3.0.0.4.376_1123]
	
	Fix: 	None.
	
* Wireless > 5.0 > Wireless Mode > "N + AC"; fails entirely; no SSID seen by NIC/adapter. Only "Auto" mode works, but that defaults to Legacy [a/b/g], even with n/ac capable NIC/adapter.

	Fix: 	None.
	

Integration Issues @ Windows 7 / Apps 

* Remote Desktop Connect [RDC] fails; NSlookup <client/computername> fails to show domain, "HTPC.Uzer_here".

	Fix:	Change Workgroup/Domain name to alpha-num chars ONLY
			
			- Enter LAN Domain Name @ WebUI/admin [192.168.1.1] ...
			   LAN > DHCP Server > RT-AC66U's Domain Name 
			- Change Win7 Workgroup name to match router's Domain Name.
			
* Lastpass OVERWRITES wireless SSID/password with router adimin login user/pass, of either 2.4GHz or 5GHz, whichever is current top-tab @ login page [whichever was last viewed?]. Worse still, the overwrite is "applied" [written to memory] as part of login process.

	Fix:	Delete fields @ Lastpass entry; enter user/pass manually
