Maximize compatibility

	All memory modules should have ...

	1. same CAS Latency (CL)
	2. same version or data code (D/C)
	3. same vendor
	
	
DDR4 SDRAM  288-pin https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR4_SDRAM#Modules

	DDR4-xxxx denotes per-bit data transfer rate
	PC4-xxxxx denotes overall transfer rate; 8 x transfers/sec
	E.g., "PC-17000" is "DDR4-2133"; 8 x 2133 = 17064

CAS Latency (CL)

	Column Access Strobe (CAS) latency, or CL; the delay time between the moment a memory controller tells the memory module to access a particular memory column on a RAM module, and the moment the data from the given array location is available on the module's output pins.

	In asynchronous DRAM, the interval is specified in nanoseconds (absolute time). In synchronous DRAM (SDRAM), the interval is specified in clock cycles. Because the latency is dependent upon a number of clock ticks instead of absolute time, the actual time for an SDRAM module to respond to a CAS event might vary between uses of the same module if the clock rate differs.
	

Timing Profiles 

	JDEC Profile

		CL-tRCD-tRP-tRAS-tRC @ frequency

		Serial Presence Detect (SPD)  1.20v  
		
			The standard way of accessing information from a memory module.
			The default memory operation frequency is dependent on SPD. 
			Under the default state, some memory modules for overclocking may operate at a lower frequency than the vendor-marked value.

	Intel XMP profile  1.35v  

		CL-tRCD-tRP-tRAS-tRC-CR @ frequency (voltage) 
		
		Frequencies higher than 2133MHz and their corresponding timing or the loaded XMP profle is NOT the JEDEC memory standard. The stability and compatibility of the memory modules depend on the CPUâ€™s capabilities and other installed devices.
		
		Load predefined and tested Intel XMP profiles through BIOS.

Hyper DIMM support is subject to CPUs. 
	Load X.M.P. or D.O.C.P. settings in BIOS for the hyper DIMM support.
