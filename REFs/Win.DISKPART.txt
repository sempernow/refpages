NOTEs
-----
	SIZE is in MB

		1 GB = 1024 MB
		10 GB = 10240 MB
		60 GB = 61440 MB
	
		1024 bytes = 1 Kb [kiloBYTE]
		1073741824 bytes = 1 MB
	
	* remove
	
		A volume is a mounted partition. 
		The assigned [assign] drive letter can be removed [remove]; 
		does NOT affect volume/partition/data, only how its handled @ current OS/environment.
		An active volume "removed" will still be bootable. 
		
		The 'remove' command hides the volume/partition from the booted OS; 
		however, the volume can still be found on boot, and from elsewhere.

		Use to create "hidden" bootable recovery partition on second physical disk, 
		so BIOS selection can be used to boot from it for recovery.
		
		Use on External, removable drives. Create small (1GB) partition ahead
		of main parittion, and install Win PE/RE on it. Don't assign (remove) drive
		letter. Then it's usable/bootable all on its own. No (other) OS required.
	
	* attrib volume set hide

		Don't use this. 

		Hiding a volume/partition on a simple volume will hide all 
		volume/partitions on that disk.
