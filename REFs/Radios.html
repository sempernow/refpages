<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_25" title="Wikipedia.org">P25</a> AKA Project 25 AKA <dfn title="Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International">APCO</dfn>-25</h3>

<p>Developed by public safety professionals in North America. Fragmented/Bureucratic per metropolis. Now has broader application worldwide, though mostly USA. P25 is <strong>digital replacement for analog UHF</strong> (typically FM) radios, adding the <strong>ability to transfer data</strong> as well as voice for more natural implementations of encryption and text messaging. P25 radios are commonly implemented by dispatch organizations, such as <strong>police</strong>, <strong>fire</strong>, <strong>ambulance</strong> and <strong>ERS</strong> (Emergency Rescue Service), using vehicle-mounted radios combined with repeaters and handheld walkie-talkie use.</p>

<ul>
<li>P25 Phase 1 : Modulation protocol pre-2012; voice only; 1 channel.</li>
<li>P25 Phase 2 : Modulation protocol 2012+; voice + data.; more advanced AMBE2+ vocoder, which allows audio to pass through a more compressed bitstream and provides two TDMA voice channels in the same RF bandwidth (12.5 kHz).</li>
</ul>

<p>The two protocols are not compatible, but Phase 2 radios are backwards compatible with phase 1 modulation and analog FM modulation, per the standard.
P25 Phase 2 infrastructure can provide a &quot;dynamic transcoder&quot; feature that <strong>translates between Phase 1 and Phase 2</strong> as needed.</p>

<p>EU has created <strong>TETRA</strong> (Terrestrial Trunked Radio) and <strong>DMR</strong> (Digital Mobile Radio) protocol standards, which fill a similar role to P25.</p>

<h4>P25 open interfaces</h4>

<p>P25's Suite of Standards specify eight open interfaces between the various components of a land mobile radio system. These interfaces are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Common Air Interface (<strong>CAI</strong>) – standard specifies the type and content of signals transmitted by compliant radios. One radio using CAI should be able to communicate with any other CAI radio, regardless of manufacturer</li>
<li>Subscriber Data Peripheral Interface – standard specifies the port through which mobiles and portables can connect to laptops or data networks</li>
<li>Fixed Station Interface – standard specifies a set of mandatory messages supporting digital voice, data, encryption and telephone interconnect necessary for communication between a Fixed Station and P25 RF Subsystem</li>
<li>Console Subsystem Interface – standard specifies the basic messaging to interface a console subsystem to a P25 RF Subsystem</li>
<li>Network Management Interface – standard specifies a single network management scheme which will allow all network elements of the RF subsystem to be managed</li>
<li>Data Network Interface – standard specifies the RF Subsystem's connections to computers, data networks, or external data sources</li>
<li>Telephone Interconnect Interface – standard specifies the interface to Public Switched Telephone Network (<strong>PSTN</strong>) supporting both analog and <strong>ISDN</strong> telephone interfaces.</li>
<li>Inter RF Subsystem Interface (<strong>ISSI</strong>) – standard specifies the interface between RF subsystems which will allow them to be connected into wide area networks</li>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mobile_radio" title="Wikipedia.org">DMR</a> (Digital Mobile Radio)</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>A digital radio standard requiring an FCC license on specific frequencies. Designed for professional, commercial, and public safety applications. It’s used by organizations that need reliable, high-quality communications over a wider area and with advanced capabilities like dispatch, location tracking, and emergency calling. It's often integrated into professional networks or <strong>used by licensed amateur radio operators</strong> on amateur bands.</p>

<p>Conventional (Direct) and Trunked modes.</p>

<p>DMR is a digital replacement for analogue PMR (Private Mobile Radio).</p>

<p>An <dfn title="European Telecommunications Standards Institute"><a href="https://www.etsi.org/technologies/mobile-radio" title="ETSI.org">ETSI</a></dfn> standard.</p>

<p>30 MHz - 1 GHz</p>

<p>12.5 kHz channel spacing (used in land mobile frequency bands globally)</p>

<p>Two voice channels through two-slot TDMA technology.</p>

<p>The PMR/DMR markets can be roughly divided into three broad categories:</p>

<h4>Tiers</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tier I</strong> : Consumer and short-range industrial.
Max 0.5W; forbids repeaters; licence-free in European PMR446 band; uses TMDA (typically).

<ul>
<li>Baofeng and others may mis-label as DMR Tier I, yet use frequencies beyond PMR446 licence–free, and have max power beyond that allowed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tier II</strong> : Professional / Business-Critical applications.<br>
66–960 MHz, two slot TDMA in 12.5 kHz channels; <strong>advanced voice features and integrated IP data services in licensed bands for high-power communications</strong>. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BTECH-DMR-6X2-136-174MHz-400-480MHz-Programming/dp/B076H96BDC/ref=sr_1_1">BTECH DMR 6X2</a></li>
<li><strong>Tier III</strong> : Public Safety / Mission-Critical applications.<br>
Same radio spec as Tier II. Supports voice and short messaging handling similar to TETRA with built-in 128 character status messaging and short messaging with up to 288 bits of data in a variety of formats. It also supports packet data service in a variety of formats, including support for IPv4 and IPv6.</li>
</ul>

<h4>DMR interface</h4>

<p>ETSI standards:</p>

<ul>
<li>TS 102 361-1: Air interface protocol</li>
<li>TS 102 361-2: Voice and General services and facilities</li>
<li>TS 102 361-3: Data protocol</li>
<li>TS 102 361-4: Trunking protocol</li>
</ul>

<h4>Channels / Licensing</h4>

<p>DMR operates in shared VHF (136-174 MHz) and UHF (403-527 MHz) bands, but specific channel access is controlled through licensing. In most countries, government agencies (like the FCC in the U.S.) allocate portions of these bands for public safety, government, commercial, and private business use.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Public Safety and Government</strong>:<br>
Access is restricted and carefully licensed.</li>
<li><strong>Business and Industrial</strong>:<br>
Licenses are available for private DMR networks
with FCC approval and frequency coordination.</li>
<li><strong>Amateur Radio Operators</strong>:<br>
Licensed &quot;hams&quot; can use DMR on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70-centimeter_band" title="Wikipedia.org">70 cm band</a>
(420-450 MHz) for non-commercial, personal communication without coordination,
provided they follow amateur radio regulations.

<ul>
<li>Also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_television">ATV</a> (Amateur Television).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>DMR is used on the <strong>amateur radio</strong> VHF and UHF bands. Coordinated DMR <strong>Identification Numbers</strong> are assigned and <strong>managed by RadioID Inc</strong>. Their coordinated database can be uploaded to DMR radios in order to display the name, call sign, and location of other operators.</p>

<h4>Repeaters / Hotspots</h4>

<p>Internet-linked systems such as DV Scotland Phoenix Network, <strong>BrandMeister</strong> network, TGIF, <strong>FreeDMR</strong> and several others <strong>allow users to communicate with other users around the world</strong> via connected repeaters, or (RPi) DMR &quot;hotspots&quot;.</p>

<p>There are <strong>currently more than 5,500 repeaters and 16,000 &quot;hotspots&quot;</strong> linked to the <strong>BrandMeister</strong> system worldwide. The low-cost and increasing availability of internet-linked systems has led to a rise in DMR use on the amateur radio bands. Some Raspberry Pi-based DMR hotspots, often those running the <a href="https://www.pistar.uk/" title="PIstar.uk"><strong>Pi-Star</strong></a> software, allow users to connect to multiple internet-linked DMR networks at the same time. DMR hotspots are often based on the FOSS Multimode Digital Voice Modem (<strong>MMDVM</strong>), hardware with firmware.</p>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TETRA" title="Wikipedia.org">TETRA</a> (Terrestrial Trunked Radio formerly Trans-European Trunked Radio)</h3>

<p>An <dfn title="European Telecommunications Standards Institute"><a href="https://www.etsi.org/technologies/mobile-radio" title="ETSI.org">ETSI</a></dfn> standard deployed in sixty countries, and the preferred choice in Europe, China, and other countries.</p>

<p>TETRA uses a four-slot TDMA in a 25 kHz channel of
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunked_radio_system" title="Wikipedia.org">trunked radio system</a></p>

<p>TETRA terminals can act as mobile phones (cell phones),
 with <strong>a full-duplex direct connection to other TETRA Users or the PSTN</strong>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXDN" title="Wikipedia.org">NXDN</a> (Next Generation Digital Narrowband)</h3>

<p>Conventional and Trunked modes. Conventional is called  Direct Mode Operation (<strong>DMO</strong>).</p>

<p>In DMO, TETRA radios operate more like traditional two-way radios in a peer-to-peer or simplex setup. It’s commonly used by first responders and organizations needing direct communication when infrastructure is unavailable.</p>

<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_VHF_radio" title="Wikipedia">Marine VHF Radio</a></h2>

<p>Emergency radio for ships; a worldwide system of two way radio transceivers on ships and watercraft used for bidirectional voice communication from ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore (for example with harbormasters), and in certain circumstances ship-to-aircraft.</p>

<p>It uses FM channels in VHF band (156 and 174 MHz), designated by the <dfn title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</dfn> as the <strong>VHF maritime mobile band</strong>. In some countries additional channels are used, such as L and F channels for leisure and fishing vessels in the Nordic countries (at 155.5–155.825 MHz). Transmitter power is limited to <strong>25 watts</strong>, giving them a range of about <strong>100 kilometres</strong> (62 mi; 54 nmi).</p>

<p>Marine VHF radio equipment is installed on all large ships and most seagoing small craft. It is also used, with slightly different regulation, on rivers and lakes. It is used for a wide variety of purposes, including marine navigation and traffic control, summoning rescue services and communicating with harbours, locks, bridges and marinas.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Channel 16 (156.8 MHz)</strong>:<br>
VHF Channel 16 is the international distress, safety,
and calling channel and is <strong>monitored continuously</strong> by the Coast Guard and other vessels.
It is used for initial distress calls, mayday signals, and other urgent communications.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Digital Selective Calling (DSC)</strong>:<br>
Modern VHF marine radios are equipped with DSC capability,
which enables a boat operator to send an <strong>automated distress signal by pressing a button</strong>.
The DSC signal includes the vessel’s identity and,
if linked to a GPS, its location, making it faster and more reliable for alerting rescuers.
DSC calls on <strong>Channel 70</strong> serve as an automated emergency alert
and reduce the time needed to reach help in an emergency.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Automatic Identification System (AIS)</strong>:<br>
Some VHF radios also include AIS capability,
which can provide <strong>vessel identification and location</strong> information in real time,
improving safety and coordination in busy waters.
This isn’t solely for emergency use
but can be valuable in <strong>collision avoidance</strong> and locating vessels in distress.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>EPIRB</strong> and <strong>PLB</strong> Devices (<strong>Beacons</strong>):<br>
While VHF radios are standard for emergency communication,
many vessels also carry Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs) or Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs).
These devices operate on <strong>satellite frequencies</strong> (406 MHz)
and can send a distress signal globally, even <strong>beyond the VHF range</strong>.</p></li>
